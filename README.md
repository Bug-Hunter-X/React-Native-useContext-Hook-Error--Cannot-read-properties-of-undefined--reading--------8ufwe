# React Native useContext Hook Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useContext` hook in React Native:  'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')'. This occurs when the component attempting to access context values doesn't have access to the context provider in its component tree.

## Bug Description:
The bug showcases an incorrect implementation of the `useContext` hook, where the context provider (`MyContextProvider`) is not correctly positioned within the component hierarchy, leading to an undefined context value.

## How to reproduce:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
4. Observe the error message in the console or on the screen.

## Solution:
The provided solution restructures the component hierarchy to ensure that `MyComponent` is correctly nested within the `MyContextProvider`, allowing the `useContext` hook to access the context values.
