This error occurs when using the `useContext` hook in React Native with a context provider that's not properly set up or is higher in the component tree than the component trying to access it.  The context value might be undefined, causing a runtime error.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage, ContextProvider might not be available to this component
const MyComponent = () => {
  const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);
  // ...
};
```
